# MetaSynth Web Interface 
[![Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Work%20in%20Progress-orange)](https://github.com/Samuwhale/MetaSynth-GUI)

This project aims to create an accessible and user-friendly web interface for the [MetaSynth](https://github.com/sodascience/metasynth) package. The MetaSynth package is designed to generate synthetic data, allowing users to work with datasets without compromising on privacy or reproducibility. By creating a web interface, this project aims to make the generation of meta- and synthetic datasets available to those less familiar with Python and expand the MetaSynth user base to non-programmers.
